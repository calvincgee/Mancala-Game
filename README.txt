Mancala Game

I have designed a mancala game with two different levels of AI: BadPlayer
and SmartPlayer.

Rules
Players take turns choosing buckets to move the stones within. When a bucket is chosen, the stones inside are placed one by one into the buckets in a counter-clockwise fashion. When passing your own bucket (the bucket on the far right) place a stone within, but do not place a stone in the opponent's bucket (far left) when you pass. If your final stone lands in an empty bucket, all of the stones in the bucket opposite are placed in your bucket. If your final stone lands in your own bucket, take another turn.

How to Play
When prompted, input the integer corresponding to the bucket that you would like to move.
