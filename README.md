# Mancala Game

This project is a console version of the classic game Mancala. This program includes two different levels of AI: a BadPlayer and a SmartPlayer. The BadPlayer AI makes moves at random. The SmartPlayer AI uses a decision tree to select the move most likely to give it the win. Good luck!

## Rules
Here is a [link](https://endlessgames.com/wp-content/uploads/Mancala_Instructions.pdf) that explains the rules of Mancala.

Essentially, players take turns choosing buckets to move the stones within. When a bucket is chosen, the stones inside are placed one by one into the buckets in a counter-clockwise fashion. When passing your own bucket (the bucket on the far right) place a stone within, but do not place a stone in the opponent's bucket (far left) when you pass. If your final stone lands in an empty bucket on your side, capture that stone and all of the stones in the bucket opposite. If your final stone lands in your own bucket, take another turn.

## Usage
